# database-management
This repository contains work for the class Database Engineering which is a Computer Science class at Marshall University.
My instructor is Benjamin Dean and I am taking the class CS 410 Section 101 Database Engineering during the Fall 2022 semester.

I am hoping to learn more about APIs and NoSQL databases with key-value pairs for big data analysis.
